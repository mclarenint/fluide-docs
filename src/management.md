### Management

#### Guest Management Tool

![](img/screen-shot-2018-07-05-at-8.21.43-pm.png)

This is the default screen for most users. It enables a guest lookup either via the guest device MAC address, or via their last name and room number \(for inhouse guests\).

The GMT will show a great amount of detail about a guest account.

The top section shows the plan parameters and how much time and data has been used in total.

The middle section shows detailed information for each of the devices that are using the plan, including device type, number of sessions, data usage and time spent online.

The bottom section is a graphical representation of the movements of each device between the various locations it is allowed to roam to.

This tool typically answers any questions the quest may have pertaining to their internet usage or account. The tool will tell you if a guest has exceeded their accounts time or data limit, the number of devices connected, the devices being used and at which locations.


#### Live Devices

The live devices log provides an easy to read overview of all devices that are currently using the Internet. The account ID can be clicked on to open the GMT for that account and see the detail. The current user is also able to sort using the arrows next to every type of information.

This is where the email distribution lists are set up for the daily reports. fluide can send daily reports for all transactions, Top20 users and all active devices. These reports are generated per location, and are divided by account type \(free / paid, inroom / hotspot, etc\).
