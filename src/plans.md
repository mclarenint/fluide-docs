### **Self-service / Inroom / Hotspot**

* Self-service plans are applied automatically to guests logging in to a specific location.
* Inroom plans require a last name and room number to log in and are checked against the propertyâ€™s PMS.
* Hotspot plans are used to create an access code at the property front desk which is given or emailed to a guest.

The plans mentioned above applies to different guest type, however, the creation and configuration of plans are similar.

#### Time and data limits

Time and data limits are used to restrict guest usage. There are two levels of restriction, Total and Cycle.

**Total** time and data limits pertain to the absolute maximum for the plan. For example a total limit of 1GB and 5 days means that the plan will get capped when either one of those limits is reached. There is no restriction of how the data gets consumed. If the guest consumes the data in the first hour, they will get capped and not be able to use their plan for the rest of the time.

**Cycle** limits can be used to further restrict the guest by setting data limits for specific time periods. For example the total could be 5GB and 5 days, with a cycle of 2GB per day. This means no more than 2GB could be used in any one day of the total 5 day plan. Once the cycle limit gets reached, the plan would be disabled for the rest of the cycle period \(in this case for the rest of the day\).
